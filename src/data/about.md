# Intro

I believe the very things that scare you, that chase you, are the very things you should face heads-on. Why keep fleeing when you can rather chase?
So, I decided the very things I'm scared of are the very things I'll do. If it's speaking to a gathering, or travelling to a new location without any map, I'll do it.
Really, what's there to loose if you take the chances, in fact you were never going to gain if you don't try in the first place. This concept keeps me going, so I try, even if all odds are against me.

# My Journey

My journey into the world of computing started with a simple curiosity about how things work. This curiosity led me to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, where I first delved into digital logic design and microprocessors. That foundational experience only deepened my interest, pushing me to explore more advanced topics, while I was a Teaching Assistant in the Department of Computer Engineering, at KNUST.

# What Drives Me?

I believe that technology holds the key to solving many of the world's challenges, and I am particularly excited about the possibilities in the post-Moore's Law era. The idea that traditional scaling is no longer enough motivates me to look for and into novel solutions, such as Processing in Memory (PIM) and domain-specific architectures. These areas of research represent not just a technical challenge but also an opportunity to make computing more efficient and accessible.

# Random Ideas

In this section, I layout some random ideas, in any domain the idea may fall in. The ideas will mostly be philosophical, bear with me.

1. I believe things work out in the end.
2. Language is an approximated model of one's thoughts.
3. Everyone at the top works hard one way or the other.
4. Wisdom cannot exist without knowledge
5. The purpose of life is to seek orderliness

# Beyond the Code

When I'm not immersed in research or working on a project, you’ll probably find me running, exploring the outdoors, or engrossed in a good book. I also enjoy listening to podcasts that cover a range of topics from true crime to history, alongside intellectual discussions by Jordan Peterson and explorations of Greek mythology. These activities help me stay grounded and offer a fresh perspective on my work.

# I Like

- Running
- Quiet
- Books
- Food
- The concept of time
- Podcasts (Serial Killers, Unsolved Murders, History of the Cold War, Greek mythologies, The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast)
- Mobile photography (I plan to explore other forms once I get an actual camera)
- The idea of skiing and skydiving—both are on my bucket list!
- My favorite TV show is Sherlock Holmes produced by BBC—a brilliant depiction of deduction and intrigue that never fails to inspire me.

# Fun facts

- The flow of time is constant, but our perception of time changes with age. Perhaps we become busier, so it keeps running out.
- I've made a couple of YouTube videos. Check it out [here](http://www.youtube.com/@nerosessi8909)!

# Finally

I’m currently on a mission to further my research in computer architecture, with a particular focus on designing high-performance, energy-efficient systems. I’m excited about the opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge research and work alongside like-minded individuals in academia or industry. If you're interested in the same fields or just want to chat about technology (or even skydiving!), feel free to reach out.

# My favourite poem

<h2 align='center'>Our Deepest Fear</h2>
<center>"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.</center>
<center>Our deepest fear in that we are powerful beyond measure.</center>
<center>It is our Light, not our Darkness, that most frightens us.</center>
<center>We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?</center>
<center>Actually, who are you not to be?</center>
<br>
<center>You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the World.</center>
<center>There is nothing enlightening about shrinking</center>
<center>so that other people won’t feel unsure around you.</center>
<center>We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us.</center>
<center>It is not just in some of us; it is in everyone.</center>
<br>
<center>As we let our own Light shine,</center>
<center>we consciously give other people permission to do the same.</center>
<center>As we are liberated from our own fear,
our presence automatically liberates others."</center>

# Some of My Poems

<h3 align='center'>Gray Ball</h3>

    Draw thine humble globe to my home
    Stir up my waters ever so slightly
    Reminisce with me the days of glory
    Make us smile 

    Remind me, your crescent shimmer 
    Bring to bear the path we chose
    Cause our jasmine to bloom
    Make us praise

    Guide us once more to your lands
    May you quench our thirst
    Be the reason for the seasons
    Make us grow

<h3 align='center'>Memories They Flip</h3>

    Only keep the good experiences they say
    Live youthful and free, be stupid and bleak 
    Only shout, at the dim snotty waiter
    Life peaceful led to dreams ashore 

    Now they lived only in memory
    Shall zero be written to all?
    Should rays make them flip?
    Must they rot to nought?

    Refreshed they recover, 
    To keep, lest perpetual 
    Draw out the power that keeps
    The last touch ablaze

<h3 align='center'>In Abundance</h3>

    Even so, some withered in the rain,
    Should the blame be the rain's?
    Is it fate to be shamed,
    While others thrive and gain?

    Dredged apart from the root,
    Amass, we wither and die,
    But can we ever be one,
    And reach up towards the sky?

    Miles away your smile flares,
    A beacon in the night,
    But still, we are divided,
    By distance and plight.

    Hitherto the bourgeois rode,
    Not of chariots with merchants,
    But on the backs of those who toil,
    Their wealth, built on burdens.

    Yet even as we face these trials,
    We must stand and hold our ground,
    For, only through our unity,
    Can true justice be found.

I hope you enjoyed them!
